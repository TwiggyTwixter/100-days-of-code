# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Updated some issues on my portfolio, completed CSS Grid on FCC, started a tribute page based on the Drifter from Destiny, and started making plans for a twitter bot.

**Thoughts:** CSS is a challenge for me. After going through the Grid course on FCC, I realized I've always made it hard for myself. I'm going to study some more css grid usage in my spare time. I also put together the boilerplate for my tribute page project on FCC. I put together some images and I'm in the process of writing out all of the info. As much as I hate to admit it, programming and web development doesn't mean just lots of hacking, it also means I'll have to actually write things which is why I've decided to do the 100 Days of Code Challenge again. 

My goal is to code at least an hour, but I want to shoot for more than an hour. I just hope I don't burn myself out.
